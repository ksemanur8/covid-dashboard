# webdev-final

Welcome to my submission for the COMP 426 Final Project.

I have developed an interactive COVID-19 dashboard. The dashboard includes:

• Sharing the top 5 COVID-related stories from The New York Times
• Sharing the latest COVID stats including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccinations and stringency level.
• A game to check your knowledge on COVID facts & myths

Features of this project include:
• Data from 4 third-party APIs.
• Buttons to toggle between dark and light mode with preferences tied to user so they don't need to be updated every time.
• Mobile-friendly interface made without the use of any CSS libraries or helpers.
• A game.

Hope you enjoy!
