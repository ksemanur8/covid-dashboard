# webdev-final

Welcome to my submission for the COMP 426 Final Project.
<br/>
I have developed an interactive COVID-19 dashboard. The dashboard includes:
<br/>
• Sharing the top 5 COVID-related stories from The New York Times
<br/>
• Sharing the latest COVID stats including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccinations and stringency level.
<br/>
• A game to check your knowledge on COVID facts & myths
<br/>
Features of this project include:
<br/>
• COVID-themed background image designed in Adobe illustrator.
<br/>
• Data from 4 third-party APIs.
<br/>
• Buttons to toggle between dark and light mode with preferences tied to user so they don't need to be updated every time.
<br/>
• Mobile-friendly interface made without the use of any CSS libraries or helpers.
<br/>
• A game.
<br/>
Hope you enjoy!
